Alphanumeric-Augmented-CNN contains a model for recognizing rotated handwritten
alphanumeric characters.

Darkflow-Geometric contains instructions for using the Darkflow YOLOv2 model on
the dataset that can be generated with scripts inside.

EMNIST-Siamese-Model contains a model of a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network
designed as a backup to the vanilla CNN to generate encodings for different
character classes.

Segmentation contains a k-means clustering implementation for segmenting shape
and character from an inputted image, as well as determining color of the
object.

Simple-NNs-and-older-versions are the models we tried before arriving at the ones above.
